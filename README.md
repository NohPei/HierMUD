### Description
This is a novel approach for multi-task unsupervised domain adaptation. We developed this approach for bridge health monitoring using drive-by vehicle vibrations, but it can be applied to other problems, such as digit recognition, image classification, etc.

![The architecture of our hierarchical multi-task and domain-adversarial learning algorithm. The red and black arrows between blocks represent source and target domain data stream, respectively. Orange blocks are feature extractors, blue blocks are task predictors, and red blocks are domain classifiers.](imgs/arch.png)

In this repository, we demonstrate our approach through a digit recognition example, which conducts two tasks: odd-even classification and digits comparison.
